# Lesson 1 - Navigating a Commit History #

Q1. 
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A1.
Comparing the two outputs from diff <file1> <file2> in bash (fc 'file compare' in windows cmd), highlighted differences in the code.  

The typo 'spacr' was an obvious error for 'space', 'r' typed instead of 'e'. 

Q2.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A2.
You can easily check the progress of development.

Q3.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A3.
You can take a more logical appoach, but there is the tendency to forget!

Q4.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A4.
To keep any dependancies current.

Q5.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A5.
After cloning the git repo (remote url) into appropriate dir, call 'git log' to see the log of the cloned git c/w commit id(s).  Call 'git diff <id_1> <id_2>' (long numbers!!! copy and paste.  

Q6.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A6.
You can always revert back to a previous working version.

Customise prompt > $ export PS1="<spec>"
export PS1="\n\[\033[0;32m\]@pyeater \[\033[0;33m\]\w\n\[\033[0;37m\]$ "
newline, green color, name, yellow color, current working dir, newline, color white, prompt

Q7.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A7.
To save (commit) python (eclipse PyDev) files (from PC & Laptop) to GitHub repo, and load  them back to remote machines.
