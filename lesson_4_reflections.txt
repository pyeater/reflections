Q1.
Reflect: Using a remote repository
Use the following reflection prompt:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A1.
Maybe when you want to share your work with others, or to keep a copy remotely to access from different machines.

Q2.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A2.
You are more likely to be working locally and so the most up to date version is not on the remote (GitHub).  There would be no new content to pull, unless it had been pushed by you from another machine or by others.  You would want to manage this manually.

Q3.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A3.
Fork makes a copy (clone) of a remote GitHub repo on your personal GitHub repos page.
Clone is a copy of a GitHub repo copied to your local machine.
Branches are local divergent copies of a local repo.  

Q4.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
